            <h2>Early Years</h2>
            <p class="aboutRishimaPara">Ever since I was a kid I was always driven to anything creative. I remember spending hours drawing and painting and sketching and coloring even though I wasn't very good at it. I also remember just standing beside my mother's dressing table and watching her as she did her makeup. Back then my mother was the go to girl if anyone wanted to get their eveliner done, including myself. I think it was the sheer act of seeing my mother do her makeup and notice how beautiful she looked afterwards which made me want to be able to do the kind of sorcery she did. </p>
            <p class="aboutRishimaPara">When I was around 14 years old, I would try different makeup looks and hairstyles on my younger sister. We would talk about our day, anything that was bothering us. It was our way of spending quality time together. </p>
            <p class="aboutRishimaPara">Halloween was my favorite day of the year as I would get a chance to dress my siblings up in over the top costumes and makeup. Halloween wasn't a huge deal back then in our small town and we would just celebrate it as a family, at home, pulling pranks on each other. I remember this one Halloween day in particular when my little brother dressed as Jigsaw, my sister as Annabelle and youngest brother as a skeleton. The funniest part is that I did not have any real makeup products so I used poster paints on them. </p>
            <p class="abourRishimaPara">In retrospect, I owe a lot of my passion towards the beauty and aesthetics industry because of my younger siblings who would always go along with my crazy plans and would let me experiment on them. </p>

            <h2>Australia</h2>
            <p class="aboutRishimaPara">Upon finishing high school, I traveled overseas in 2016 for my graduation and I completely lost touch with my creative element. But it was in Australia where I experienced what makeup truly looked like. The first time I went to Sephora I remember feeling like I was in heaven. It was then that I decided that someday I wanted to work here. </p>
            <p class="aboutRishimaPara">This dream came true back in November 2021 when I started off a part-time job at Sephora. It was here that I got hands-on experience as a makeup artist and acquired practical knowledge of the thousands of products and brands that call Sephora their home.

            <h2>Foundation Stones of Rishima Makeup Artist</h2>
            <p class="aboutRishimaPara">It was back in 2020 when Melbourne was in strict lockdown that I started my instagram page which was then named @beautybyrish. I started that page as a way for me to pass time and for it to be a safe and creative outlet for me. I remember buying a couple of eyeshadow palettes from Morphe along with some brushes and I started posting editorial style eyeshadow looks in the form of pictorials, tutorials and reels. </p>
            <p class="aboutRishimaPara">Later on, one of my closest friends in the world (who is now a part- time makeup artist in Melbourne) decided that we should enroll ourselves in a makeup course. It was at this point that we registered ourselves with the Academy of Hair and Makeup with my long-term goal being to establish myself as a well renowned makeup artist in India.</p>
            <p class="aboutRishimaPara">Fast Forward to 2022 when I returned back to India and in September, started my business as Rishima Aggarwal Makeup Artist.</p>
